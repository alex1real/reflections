1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git control hidden folders and files are created.
You need to do this for use git as a version control.


2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains all files, while the stage area contains only a subset.
The value is that you can tracking in a single commit only the files that matter to a logical change, instead of all files in directory.
